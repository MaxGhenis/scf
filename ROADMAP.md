# `scf` roadmap

`scf` currently provides capabilities for loading the Survey of Consumer Finances summary microdata.
In the future, it will provide more functionality, including:
* Functions to summarize the microdata, e.g., wealth distributions over time.
* Charts to visualize these summaries.
* Standard error calculations for full SCF microdata files.

See the [issues page](https://github.com/MaxGhenis/scf/issues) to view and suggest other items.
